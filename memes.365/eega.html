When seen, it's okay,

How can you still smile?
You've been after her madly
for 2 years now!
Did she care to look back at you?
You took trouble to light her room,
did she atleast thank you?
She drew the curtains down
for the love she has for me.
What?
- Yes!
lf she doesn't, she knows
l'll keep awake all night here.
Darkness, fog, chill, she can't bear
to see me falling sick.
That's why, though she doesn't like it,
she closed it against her will.

Don't imagine too much.
lts late night!
Scared...l mean l'm scared!
Can l walk with you?

At times you're proud...
At times you're little open...
At times you may chide me...
At times you may smile
faintly at me...
lnto your deep heart...
May l with magnifying glass...
See myself in some corner of it...
Can't you have a glance at me?
Can't you have a word with me?
At least show annoyance on me...
Can't you ask me if you
want to get praised?
l'm going mad slowly for you,
but you've no sympathy for me...
You're a miserly girl...
why don't you talk to me?
Bring down the fence
surrounding you...
Just send me a message
through wind...
l'll be with you in ajiffy...
Though l don't have wings,
Won't l take you to the stars?
Let it be any life...
Won't l be your life partner?
Don't you know my heart is
residing happily in your heart?
Don't you know my heart is
residing happily in your heart?
Why are you beating me?
l don't know who you are!
Please leave me...please...
Any woman would follow me
madly like a dog,
but l didn't get her
because of you.
Who are you talking about, sir?
- Bindu!
Stay away from Bindu!
l'll kill you!
Will you kill me?
Will you kill me?
My Bindu is asking
where you are!
Tell her that you're dying
at my feet!
Remove the shoes and socks.
l want to feel your life slip away!
lt must look like an accident.
Nani, its Bindu here!
Why don't you talk to me?
Are you taking revenge on me for

Why don't you look at me for once?
Bindu...Bindu...look at me...
Don't go away from me...
Why did you get ready so early?
- To office.
Your office starts at 10 am,
why are you leaving at 7 am?
Why are you washing utensils?
We're paying maid servant to do that.
Go, sit there.
What happened to you, Bindu?
You always avoided household work,
but now you're working all through
the day without rest.
Why don't you talk to me?
What happened?
l'm trying to forget
by keeping myself busy.
What?
Who?
Nani!
- Nani?
l teased him by acting as
if l don't care about him.
But he has gone far
beyond my reach!
He's teasing me now!
They say crying will
ease your heart.
But the more l cry the more
l remember him, sister-in-law.
That's why l don't want to cry.
ln your happiest moment,
to give it to you...
Nani made these special
crackers for you.
Bye!
Are you missing Nani?
How do you know it?
My wife's death!
On her death bed, holding my hand,
she took a promise from me,
if she dies, l must forget me,
she said she'll be happy
only if l forget her.
lf you really love Nani,
you must forget him.
What happened, sir?
Nothing...
Nothing...
Any problem?
There l was...
What happened, sir?
l did this to gain your trust.

Get me out!
Be careful!
Do it fast!
Slowly...slowly...
Didn't you hear me?

What are you doing sir?
No sir!
No sir, don't beat me sir.
- Stay put there!
MD is fully exposed in the
Ganapathi Chemical scam.
He'll be stripped!
Sir, please leave me.
You asked me to meet
you urgently, sir.
l met Education Minister
in Delhi last week.
lf you meet him and
explain the details,
we'll get national recognition.
- National level?
l'm going to Delhi tomorrow,
if anyone of you join me,
l'll introduce you to him.

You go with him, Bindu.

What are you thinking?
You go with him.
Sir, Bindu will come with you.
What are you thinking?
You must go with him.
Go!

You go!

Let's meet at airport tomorrow.
What the hell are you doing

Room is full of flies!
Full of flies!
Boy, only pigs come in groups!
Lion attacks alone!
Attacks alone!
Sir, Bindu here!
Sir, its Bindu here!
Yes Bindu!

Just 30 minutes to board the flight.

Why did you shove into this place?
What man?

My car is stuck in traffic jam,

Take my car, sir.
Give him the keys.
Bindu, l'm on the way..
No problem sir,

You can reach in time.
- l'll reach.
Fly...fly...death knell to you...
Fly...fly...
Though met with a serious accident,
you escaped with minor injuries.
Give me your hand,
l'll check your BP.
What's this?
- Fly repellant.
You take it.
- Give.
Not that, take my BP!
l'll give sedation to sleep,
give him Diazepam 2 ml.
l'll take leave now.
Do animals take revenge?
Didn't you hear me?
Do-animals-take-revenge?
They do sir...
in Vittalacharya's films!
Not in films, but in real life!
lt happens in real life too sir.
My grandma said!
lt seems a King Cobra took
revenge on my grandpa.
Not that smaller ones!
- Smaller ones too take revenge.
Others...
- Smaller snakes too take revenge.
Not snakes!
Smaller ones...like sparrow!
Frog!
Fly!
- Fly?
lt will, sir! lf snakes can,
why not flies?
ldiots!
With whom should l share this problem?
How am l to tell?
l don't get it.
Sir, Bindu madam is here.
What's in your hand?
A fly is irritating me.
Bindu...Bindu...look at me...
Don't go away from me...
Tell me.
A small doubt.
Do flies target humans specifically?
l mean remember humans
and attack with a plan.
Planning to write science fiction, sir?
This is a fact not science fiction.
A fly is not letting me to eat,
sleep or live peacefully.
This accident too is its handiwork!
lt wrote 'l will kill you'
on the windshield.
ls it science fiction?
You said you didn't sleep all the night.
Already you're highly stressed,
accident happened then,
and a fly too disturbed you
at the same time.
You'd have imagined fly was
responsible for it in that stress.
You need a psychiatrist's help.
You're not yet done with!
Come!
Go away!
Why would you come to me now?
Safe locker and match box!
When your face gets smeared by soot,
you'll come to me.
Who the hell is he?
ls it imagination?
Bindu, come for dinner.
What happened?
Nani's locket is broken, sister-in-law.
You know Nani will not come back,
how long will you live in his memories?
Snap your relationship with him
like this broken locket.
My love is all yours...
lt's just a dream...
Leave all your sorrows...
l'm Nani.
l'm Nani, reborn.
Are you Nani?
Are you really Nani?
l can't believe it.
Nani born again?
You died in an accident, right?
Wasn't it an accident?
Then?
Sudeep!
What about Sudeep?
Sudeep...did he kill you?
Why would he kill you?
For me?
But why you?
What should l do now?
How to kill him?
Look, the night is looming
large over...
Death is knocking at your door...
Fly...fly...fly...
My name is Nani,
l may be just a fly...
l'm a nuclear missile about
to explode in your heart...
Your range may be large and
my size may be small...
lf l don't bring down your empire,
l'm not a man...
Fly...fly...fly...
death knell to you...
l'll take your life easily...
Though it's just a spark...
Doesn't it have the power
to burn down a forest?
Though it may be just a drop...
Doesn't it have the power
to drown the earth?
What can an ordinary
house f1ly do to me?
Before you relax with
that confidence...
Won't l enter your breath
like bio virus?
lt's burning, put it off!
Many a things to be done
before the deadline...
Just ten things!
One, to kill you...
two, to kill you...
Three, to kill you...
four, to kill you...
Five, to kill you...
six, to kill you...
Seven, to kill you...
eight, to kill you...
Nine, to kill you...
Ten, to hound and
pound you to death...
l'll shuffle my wings...
l'll ring the death knell
in your ears...
l'll attack you like
a suicide bomber...
By hook or crook l'll kill you
and become a martyr...
Death is nothing for a man
who died once...
What can an ordinary
house fly do to me?
Won't l fly away like a rocket
after taking your life?
ls this your hideout?
Got it! l got it!
Die...die...
Die...die...
A cappuccino for me, and for you?
You too like cappuccino?
Sorry, madam!
A fly in your coffee.
Fly is having coffee.
What's the next program?
Did you order for bullet proof glasses?
- l have sir.
Not just flies, even air mustn't
enter without our knowledge.
You want me to make it airtight, sir?
Let me how will it dare enter now!
Go in sir.
Sir, l found it!
Look, it's in his hair!
What are you searching? Beat it.
Why are you beating me?
Check his collar. lt's in his collar.
lt's escaping, watch out!
Please sit here.
Dropped in just to inquire
about your health, sir.
Antique statues are very beautiful.
You like it?
My personal collection.
The place you're standing was
my wife's favourite spot.
What happened, sir?
l love your wife's favourite spot.
Shall we sit there, sir?
l forgot something...

l wanted to spend some time with you.
Can't you go little late?
This time...
l'll not take much time, sir.
Open the door.
Fly...fly...fly...
death knell to you...
l'll take your life easily...
Fly
What's this signature?
Do you know how big project
we're dealing with?
Get out!
Get another copy!
Hey thief! Are you here?
l know where you are hiding!
Come out!
Don't try too much!
Did you accomplish the
task successfully?
Who are you talking to Bindu?
l'm talking over phone, sister-in-law.
You're smart, you can hide
anywhere you want to.
l'm getting into trouble
because of you.
Can l tell my sister-in-law
that you're my lover?
There's only one way out!
You must become human!
You don't worry, you'll change.
l've full faith in our love.
l beg you, buddy!
Ensure this meeting goes well!
They're here to invest
Rs.2000 crores.
lf you mess up,
we'll lose Rs.2000 crores,
and have to return their advance
of Rs.500 crores with interest.
Don't l know this?
l think you'll invest more after
seeing our presentation.
Don't get surprized!
We know his passion of racing!
He's symbolically telling you
we'll finish the project like that.
He has come wearing a helmet.
2000 crores!
We'll go to the streets!
lt'll be the country's
largest township.
With the investment you've made,
bought 5000 tons of steel,
10000 tons of cement,
and 15000 tons of fly repellant.
Fly repellant?
Bricks! Who said fly repellant?
Am l scared of flies?
B-R-l-C-K-S!
Any prospective buyer must kill
at least 1000 flies to get our flat.
When all the flies are wiped out,
Sudeep township will be at peace...
...happy...silent...
will be peaceful!
What's this nonsense?
ls it board meeting or TV program
to kill flies and mosquitoes?
Repellent is not effective!
l know that repellents are
not effective on flies.
Hey you...
You don't feel bad sir.
l'll clean it myself.
Get me the Commissioner on line.
l'll give you a tip,
can you raid immediately?
Sir, we're in a soup, Mukesh has
called lncome Tax Commissioner.
He gave him a tip of raiding us.
- What?
Entire cash is in office.
Safe locker and match box!
When your face gets smeared by soot,
you'll come to me.
l lost everything,
your words have come true.
Seed for your death was sown here!
l killed Nani here!
Nani...fly...
Nani is reborn as fly!
Stay away from Bindu!
l'll kill you!
You're right, Nani is the fly...
What should l do now?
Conduct a sacrifice immediately!
Look there! lt's stuck!
Do something man!
Chant some hymns!
Put motifs! Open the door!
There are no hymns
to open the shut door.
Stay away from Bindu!
l'll kill you!
l-W-l-L-L-K-l-L-L-Y-O-U!
lf l was a minute late,
you'd be dead by now.
What's this nonsense
with witchcraft?
What's going on here?
Okay, who is that dead man?
Tantra!
Why did he come here?
To kill the fly!
Fly...fly...what's this
madness about flies?
Are you scared of a silly fly?
What silly fly?
Do you know its capacity?
You kill it! lf you're a man,
kill it, l'll watch it.
Kill it!
You've lost your mind!
l'm telling you the truth.
That fly is Nani, the man l killed.
lt's him! He's reborn as fly!
That fly created that accident
and burnt our cash.
l made foolproof arrangements
to keep it out of home.
l didn't let even a pinhole open
for air also to enter,
but that fly comes in
from somewhere...
What happened?
A mask and weapons for the fly...
Bindu is unscrewing it.
You were right!
Nani is the fly!
Sorry buddy! l didn't believe you.
We know Bindu is an accomplice
of the fly!
lt's not big deal to
finish them off.
l'll take care of it.
Before that we must stop the investors
who are hell bent on ruining us.
lf we don't pay by tomorrow,
they'll go to the court.
Think about that first.
What if one of our partners dies?
Contract will get cancelled.
Moreover we'll get Rs.700 crores
from insurance.
What are you saying?
Will you commit suicide?
Where are you?
Playing games with me?
Okay.
Why are you so shocked?
Did l surprize you by coming up?
Door was open downstairs and
nobody was there, so l came up.
No problem sir.
l want to discuss important
matter with you.
Please come with me.
l've work...
You won't think l'm mad after
hearing what l say, right?
A fly is trying to kill me!
Don't believe it?
l know you'll believe it.
More shocking than that is...
Someone is helping
that fly to kill me.
Do you believe it?
l do if you say so...
When l told this to others,
they said l'm mad.
Look at this!
lt was caught on CCTV camera.
When l zoom it...
lt has a mask, goggles...
did you see?
But a fly can't make it, right?
Somebody must've made it
for the fly.
Don't cry, mad girl.
l'll be fine.
Only micro artists can create
such minute articles.
But who would want me dead, Bindu?
You too are a micro artist.
Do you know who wants me dead?
l used to get any woman l desire
at the snap of a finger,
you made a mad man stamping flies!
Hey Nani boy! Where are you hiding?
Come out!
l know you're here!
Like every time you sneak
in stealthily...
Come straight and
fall at my feet!
lf not l'll cut her throat!
Come out Nani!
You don't know how l killed him
in his previous birth, right?
Take off my shoes.
l want to feel your life slip away!
Catch Bindu!
You're finished today!
Not here, search behind the curtains.
Where are the bullets?
- Used everything sir.
Drag her to me!
- Madam is missing.
Did Bindu manage to escape?
No sir, door is locked,
security men are inside.
Back door is also locked, sir.
There's no way she can escape.
She would be hiding
somewhere here only.
Find her!
l got him! l got him!
After torturing me for 20 long days
and suddenly getting caught,

Do you want me to believe it?
Nani, you're finished!
See, how nicely it is flying!
lt's not over yet!
Hold it!
Pierce it!
Please leave it sir.
- Pierce there!
l beg you sir, please leave him.
Started it just now and
you want me to stop it?
You both had played with
my life for so many days.
Did l ask you to stop it?
Where did l stop it?
You're missing him,
concentrate Bindu.
Aim and pierce it right
through his heart!
Did you think l'll pierce it?
Okay!
Okay.
Do you both communicate too?
What is he saying?

Don't worry about this rogue!
l'll kill him before l die!
l'll burn him down to ashes!
Will you burn me down?
Still proud even at
the face of death!
l'll show you what burning is!
Get me a match box!
Life or death is for you only...
l'm saving my love...
lt'll burn you!
Stay away from Bindu!
l'll kill you!
Fly...fly...fly...
death knell to you...
My name is Nani,
l may be just a fly...
l'm a nuclear missile about
to explode in your heart...
Your range may be large and
my size may be small...
lf l don't bring down your empire,
l'm not a man...
Fly...fly...fly...
death knell to you...
l'll take your life easily...
Story is very father but
what happened to the thief?
That thief? Bindu said
you must change, right?
He changed!
He changed and know

Would you like to have a peg?
Get lost!
You're a good worker,

You can make money.

to test my luck...
Promising to take me to the top...
Two prayer tickets please.
Take it.
What do you want please?
l don't see you here quite
often now, are you fine?

Why did you buy two tickets?
That is...
- Any good news?
Yes.
Who is he?
lt may be unpalatable to you.
Beat him...beat the crook!
How dare you try to steal
a temple, you drunkard!
You're getting me beaten mercilessly,
can you bet me a bottle of whisky?
Though beaten up, no remorse,
beat him black and blue.
Didn't you find a human
to fall in love?
l told you it'll be
unpalatable to you.
lt's a new lease of life to him!
lt's all your goodness!
Give it with your hands,
everything will be fine!
